Hi my name is Zak!

This is my blog about being the InfoSec industry.

You'll find helpful scripts, guides and my own review on different tools. Maybe I'll get round to doing a YouTube channel... who knows! 

I have a huge passion for Cyber Security and will post info on Bug Bounties and CVE hunting.

Thanks for stopping by,

Zak
